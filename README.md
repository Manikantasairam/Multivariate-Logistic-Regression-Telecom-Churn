<b>Multivariate-Logistic-Regression-Telecom-Churn</b>

Let's now look at the process of building a logistic regression model in Python.

You will be looking at the <b>telecom churn prediction example</b>. You will use 21 variables related to customer behaviour (such as the monthly bill, internet usage etc.) to predict whether a particular customer will switch to another telecom provider or not (i.e. churn or not).

<b>Problem Statment</b>
You have a telecom firm which has collected data of all its customers. The main types of attributes are:

<ul><li> Demographics (age, gender etc.) </li>
<li>Services availed (internet packs purchased, special offers taken etc.)</li>
<li>Expenses (amount of recharge done per month etc.)</li> </ul>

Based on all this past information, you want to build a model which will predict whether a particular customer will churn or not, i.e. whether they will switch to a different service provider or not. So the variable of interest, 
i.e. the target variable here is ‘Churn’ which will tell us whether or not a particular customer has churned. It is a binary variable - 1 means that the customer has churned and 0 means the customer has not churned.
